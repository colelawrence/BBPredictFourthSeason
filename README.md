# CSC 590: Baseball predict fourth season

The goal of this project is to use Weka to make a prediction on how a player will perform in their fourth season on any given statistic.

## Favorite Toy Predictions

This project is based off of the formula embedded in the the favorite toy algorithm for predicting the future seasons of a player by using that attribute's previous three seasons.

The [formula is referenced from Baseball Reference](http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Favorite_toy) and it looks like this:

> Established level for that statistic = (last season*3+second to last season*2+third to last season)/6.
> Additionally, the established level should not be below 3/4 of the total in the most recent season

Our goal, is to improve this established statistic.

## Data Transformation

Baseball statistical data is based off the [baseballdatabank provided by chadwickbureau](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank).

We reference these files such as `./Master.csv`, `./Batting.csv`, etc in the codebase, but we are not including them.

### Transformation 1

The first transformation joins all statistics between playerIDs and birthYears available from Master.csv and the stats in the other data files. Then, it also aggregates player-years with multiple stints (So, if player hits 30 on one team, switches teams, then hits 10 on next team, we are outputted 40 hits for that player-year entry).

**Output**

| playerID  | yearID |`B_G`|`B_AB`|`B_R`|`B_H`| ... |
|-----------|--------|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|
| aaronha01 |   1954 | 122 |  468 |  58 | 131 | ... |
| aaronha01 |   1955 | 153 |  602 | 105 | 189 | ... |
| aaronha01 |   1956 | 153 |  609 | 106 | 200 | ... |
| aaronha01 |   1957 | 151 |  615 | 118 | 198 | ... |

Transformation 1 has been implemented with two solutions, [one in Python by Frank Giddens](transform-1_aggregate-stats_frank), and [another using SQLite commands by Cole Lawrence](./transform-1_aggregate-stats-alt_cole)

### Transformation 2

The second tranformation takes the output of the first transformation to
rotate the data into groups of four consecutive seasons for analysis.

This has been written as a [Jupyter notebook by Jia](./transform-2_four-seasons_jia/four_seasons.ipynb).

And generates the appropriate file based on the gui selections made.

**Output**

[`last_four_years_playerID_H.csv`](transform-2_four-seasons_jia/last_four_years_playerID_H.csv)

|  playerID | yearID | season1 | season2 | season3 | season4 |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| blowemi01 |   1990 |      27 |       7 |      14 |     106 |
| blowemi01 |   1991 |       7 |      14 |     106 |      78 |
| blowemi01 |   1992 |      14 |     106 |      78 |     113 |
| blowemi01 |   1993 |     106 |      78 |     113 |      84 |
| blowemi01 |   1994 |      78 |     113 |      84 |      44 |
| blowemi01 |   1995 |     113 |      84 |      44 |      97 |
| hillech01 |   1962 |     166 |      93 |      37 |      69 |

### Transformation 3

Finally, we've added a rudimentary age using the Master.csv data's birthYear difference from yearID.

**Output**

[`aH.csv`](transform-3_add-age_cole/aH.csv)

|  playerID | age | season1 | season2 | season3 | season4 |
|-----------|-----|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| blowemi01 |  25 |      27 |       7 |      14 |     106 |
| blowemi01 |  26 |       7 |      14 |     106 |      78 |
| blowemi01 |  27 |      14 |     106 |      78 |     113 |
| blowemi01 |  28 |     106 |      78 |     113 |      84 |
| blowemi01 |  29 |      78 |     113 |      84 |      44 |
| blowemi01 |  30 |     113 |      84 |      44 |      97 |
| hillech01 |  28 |     166 |      93 |      37 |      69 |


### Analysis

Using aH with Weka, we generated a MultiLayerPeceptron which predicts the next season slightly better (based on RMSE) than the given favorite toy algorithm.

First, we removed the playerID in Weka since it has no impact on the prediction.
